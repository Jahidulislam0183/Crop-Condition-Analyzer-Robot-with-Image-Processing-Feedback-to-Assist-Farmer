# Crop-Condition-Analyzer-Robot-with-Image-Processing-Feedback-to-Assist-Farmer

This research presents an autonomous robotic technology to assist the farmer by detecting the disease of leaf (guava as sample one) along with measuring the temperature and humidity. The initial goal was to implement a prototype and test its feasibility for helping the farmer to find out the diseases easily. The prototype has been designed with two features. One is motion and the second one is analysis with image processing along with real-time data processing. In motion part, the robot is taking the decision whether to take left turn, right turn or stop, based on three specific range of colors (preset on the field). In the second part the robot analyzes whether the leaf is normal or affected by disease. The temperature and humidity monitoring of the environment is an additional feature of the prototype. This prototype has been developed with the intention to assist the farmer for saving their time and for the improvement of instant agricultural decisions.
